## Hardware Prototype of a Reaction Time Game
This is the 3x3 prototype of the upcoming 6x7 reaction time game prototype.

The game is a reaction time game where the player has to press the button that lights up as fast as possible. The game will keep track of the score and display it in the end.

The game also includes some idle animations and other games as Tic Tac Toe.

The game is built using an ESP32 microcontroller and a 16x16 LED matrix.
As inputs we have 9 buttons in a 3x3 grid.

The real Prototype will have 42 buttons in a 6x7 grid. Where the player can press right on the button that lights up.
